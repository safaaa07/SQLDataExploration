The main focus of the project is to explore some [data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) about Covid-19 around the world, mainly deaths and vaccinations.

### Checking if the data was imported correctly 

As a first time user of MS SQL Management Studio, I used the first two queries to make sure that the data was imported correctly from my Excel files.


### Query 1

I then selected only the data we'll be using from the deaths DB.


### Query 2

This query shows the total number of covid cases, the total covid deaths and the death percentage in Canada.


### Query 3

This query shows what percentage of Canada's population got Covid.

### Query 4

This query classifies the countries, with the highest infection rate at the top of the list.


### Query 5

This query classifies the countries, with the highest death count at the top of the list.


### Query 6

This query shows the count of total covid cases for each continent.


### Query 7

This query classifies the continents, with the highest death count at the top of the list.


### Query 8

This query arranges some global numbers by date.


### Query 9

This Query shows the global number of cases, the global number of deaths and the death percentage.


### Query 10

This query shows the total population vs New Vaccinations.


### Query 11 to 14

Different ways to show the sum of new vaccinations and the percentage of population vaccinated.
